# Flutterwave React Native Web View Component

This is the react native SDK for Rave By [Flutterwave.](https://rave.flutterwave.com) that utilizes webview in displaying the Rave modal

This SDK allows you plug-in Rave's payment gateway directly into your react native application and start accepting payment immediately, utilizing all avaliable payment methods, by setting the payment method you want from your Rave Dashboard

This package copies a similar loading design to that of Rave, which makes transistion to Rave's website less noticeable. This package also offers a cancel button, so one can easily cancel if Rave takes a long time to load its content (the `onCancel` props event is called when this happens).

### Compatibility

| `@react-native-community/cli`                                    | `react-native` |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [^1.0.0](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/tree/1.x) | ^0.59.0        |

### Integrating Rave React Native

You can pull in react-native-rave-webview into app with the steps below;

-   Change directory into your current project directory from your terminal and enter this command:

    > npm i rave-reactnative-wrapper --save

## Usage

#### 1. import Rave Component

    import { Rave } from 'rave-reactnative-wrapper';

#### 2. You can import shortid to use as your txref generator

    import shortid from 'shortid'; //   Feel free to use your own logic/ package to generate unique references

#### 2. Set your success, failure and close methods

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

      }

       onSuccess(data) {
       // PLEASE CALL THE FLUTTERWAVE VERIFY ENDPOINT TO CONFIRM TRANSACTION STATUS

        console.log("success", data);
        // You get the complete response returned that comes from Rave,


      }

     onCancel(data) {
    	// PLEASE CALL THE FLUTTERWAVE VERIFY ENDPOINT TO CONFIRM TRANSACTION STATUS
    	console.log(data);
     }

      onError(data) {
        //an error occoured
    // PLEASE CALL THE FLUTTERWAVE VERIFY ENDPOINT TO CONFIRM TRANSACTION STATUS

      }

#### 3. Build your own Pay button component (Make sure you pass down the props.onpress into it)

```
const PayNow = (props) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={{}} onPress={props.onPress}>
      <View>
        <Image source={""} style={{}} />
      </View>
      <Text style={{}}>Pay Now</Text>
      <Entypo name="chevron-thin-right" color="#C7C7CC" size={18} />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

#### 4. Use component (ensure to set currency for the desired payment method to display)

     render() {
         return (
            <View  style={styles.container}>
              <Rave
                    buttonText="Pay with Flutterwave"
                    raveKey="FLWPUBK_TEST-e2edac55d072562ca37a991a3d97eeb3-X"
                    amount={10}
                    currency={'NGN'}
                    country={'NG'}
                    customerEmail={'team9.tech@gmail.com'}
                    customerPhone={'08114089344'}
                    customer_firstname={'First Name'}
                    customer_lastname={'Last Name'}
                    ActivityIndicatorColor="black"
                    payment_options="card"
                    onCancel={onCancel}
                    onSuccess={onSuccess}
                    onError={onError}
                    txref={shortid()}
                />
            </View>
        );
       }
